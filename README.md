# TechStore

Welcome to the E-commerce app repository! This project showcases a robust and scalable e-commerce application built using .NET Core for the backend, Angular for the frontend, and a range of complementary technologies.

## Backend

The backend of the application is developed using **.NET Core**, providing a solid foundation for the project. I leveraged the power of **C#** to implement the business logic, handle data processing, and integrate various functionalities required for an e-commerce platform.

## Frontend

On the frontend, I utilized **Angular**, a popular JavaScript framework, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. **TypeScript** was employed to develop structured and maintainable code, enhancing the development process.

To enhance performance and optimize data retrieval, I incorporated **Redis**, an in-memory data structure store. This enables efficient caching of frequently accessed data, resulting in improved response times and overall system performance.

Additionally, I made use of **Bootstrap**, a widely adopted CSS framework, to streamline the design and layout of the application. Bootstrap provides a collection of responsive components and utility classes, making it easier to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly interfaces.

Throughout the development process, I employed **SCSS** (Sass) to write efficient and modular CSS styles, enabling easy customization and consistent styling across the application.

## Deployment

The project is containerized using **Docker**, ensuring consistent and reliable deployment across different environments. Docker simplifies maintenance and enhances scalability, making it easier to manage and scale the e-commerce application.

Feel free to explore the codebase and delve into the various technologies utilized in this e-commerce app.
