Welcome to my E-commerce app repository! This project showcases my skills in building a robust 
and scalable e-commerce application using .NET Core for the backend, Angular for the frontend, 
and a range of complementary technologies.

The backend of the application is developed using .NET Core, providing a solid foundation for the project. 
I leveraged the power of C# to implement the business logic, handle data processing, and integrate various 
functionalities required for an e-commerce platform.

On the frontend, I utilized Angular, a popular JavaScript framework, to create a dynamic and responsive user interface. 
TypeScript was employed to develop structured and maintainable code, enhancing the development process.

To enhance performance and optimize data retrieval, I incorporated Redis, an in-memory data structure store. 
This enables efficient caching of frequently accessed data, resulting in improved response times and overall system performance.

Additionally, I made use of Bootstrap, a widely adopted CSS framework, to streamline the design and layout of the application. 
Bootstrap provides a collection of responsive components and utility classes, making it easier to create visually appealing and mobile-friendly interfaces.

Throughout the development process, I employed SCSS (Sass) to write efficient and modular CSS styles, 
enabling easy customization and consistent styling across the application.

The project is containerized using Docker, ensuring consistent and reliable deployment across different environments. 
Docker simplifies maintenance and enhances scalability, making it easier to manage and scale the e-commerce application.

Feel free to explore the codebase and delve into the various technologies utilized in this e-commerce app.
